-- | Co-records: a flexible approach to sum types. 'Frames.Melt.melt'
-- is a good example of how such a facility is useful in @Frames@
-- usage scenarios.
--
-- Consider a record with three fields @A@, @B@, and @C@. A record is
-- a product of its fields; that is, it contains all of them: @A@,
-- @B@, /and/ @C@. If we want to talk about a value whose type is one
-- of those three types, it is /any one/ of type @A@, @B@, /or/
-- @C@. The type @CoRec '[A,B,C]@ corresponds to this sum type.
